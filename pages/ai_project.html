                <p class="full-content">This project focuses on creating a language detection system using machine learning techniques. It begins by analyzing a dataset containing text samples paired with their respective languages, such as English, French, and Spanish. By processing this data, the system learns patterns that distinguish one language from another. Advanced tools like Pythonâ€™s pandas and scikit-learn are used to organize the data, transform language labels into machine-readable formats, and prepare it for model training. For technical readers, this includes steps like label encoding and exploratory data analysis. For non-technical readers, the goal is to build a tool that can identify the language of a given text, potentially useful in applications like translation services, content categorization, or social media analytics.</p>
